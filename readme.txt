This plugin provides a shortcode that allows to embed a Google Trends graph in your website through a very easy-to-use wizard!

== Description ==

If you want to embed Google Trends graphs in your website this is the plugin for you: with a simple shortcode you will get the graph you need in a few seconds. A nice wizard will help you choosing the proper options and automatically get the needed shortcode.

Apart from the keywords for which you want the analytics, through the shortcode builder you can specify:   
* dimensions of the graph (in pixels)    
* geolocalization (using the two letters country code)     
* whether you want to use average values rather than the standard ones      
* start date of the graph     
* timeframe of the graph (from the starting date - in months)     

The plugin is now fully localized in English, Italian and Spanish!
